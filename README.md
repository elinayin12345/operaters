## Arithmetic Operaters
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Modulo/Remainder (%)

*Note:* Integer Division is truncated

*Ex:* `22/6 = 3`

Be carefu; when doing this. `(double)(3/4) = 0.0`
- Integer division is computed first before casting to `double`

The arithemtic aperatos follow normal precedence rules ( order of operations)

1. parentheses, from the inner ones out
2. *,/,%
3.+,-
